                <h1>Web Designer</h1>
                <p>If "designer" is in the title, the job is designing. Literally deciding and implementing how websites look and work. "Web" is in the title because the job is specifically focused on applications hosted on the internet. Specific skills
                    would be design-tools-of-choice (e.g. Abobe Creative Cloud), HTML, CSS, and light JavaScript. If the job is also designing for print, apps, signage, products, clothing, etc., the title would be widened to Graphic Designer. This job
                    role requires someone with a keen eye for detail, creativity, adaptability and good understanding of the need to optimise assets for the task at hand.
                </p>

                <h1>Front End Developer</h1>
                <p>This job is focused on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and light backend work. Not design. The lack of "designer" in the title is intentional. Because the job doesn't require design, deeper skill in the other technologies is implied. You likely
                    have a grasp on some concepts beyond the core technologies, for instance regression testing or performance. A synonym might be Front End Engineer. I tend to think of that as a requiring a deeper and more specific skillset, possibly
                    with more narrow focus or at a higher level. Technology specific job titles may be also be appropriate here, like "JavaScript Developer" or "JavaScript Engineer" for a job where that is primarily what needs to be done. Although, none
                    of the front end technologies live in a bubble so I generally prefer Front End Developer.
                </p>

                <h1>Web Developer</h1>
                <p>This job is focused on back end work and working with languages specific to the web, like C++, C#, .NET, PHP, Ruby, Python, etc. Medium skill in database/server work, medium skill in JavaScript, light skill in HTML. This is very different
                    from a Front End Developer as there is little working with the design and heavier on programming concepts and concerns, like security and structure.</p>

                <h1>Full Stack Developer</h1>
                <p>This job is a combination of front and back end work. Seriously though, not mostly one and a little of the other. Good crossover people are needed at organizations and this is a high end job.</p>

                <h1>Content Strategist</h1>
                <p>Rather than working directly on implementation, this job is about the structural design of websites. Things like the taxonomies, metadata, scheduling, and analysis of content. A synonym might be Information Architect. They might work with
                    people who work with content in a more general way like a Writer, Copywriter, or Editor.</p>

                <h1>IT Technician</h1>
                <p>This job works with the actual computers and tech equipment. A hardware person.</p>

                <h1>Dev Ops</h1>
                <p>The job bridges the gap between IT and Developers. They handle things like server software, version control, deployment, build processes, and testing servers/processes. I wish this had a more job-title-y feeling to it. As it stands it
                    sounds like what you would call the whole team of people with this job.</p>

                <h1>Product Manager</h1>
                <p>This job is about guiding the site as a whole (or a major feature of the site) toward a better future. Largely dealing with people and planning. A Project Manager would be similar but smaller in scope and possibly a temporary role rather
                    than full job title. The product manager will work directly with the team developing the website, making decisions on behalf of the company and the client and answering any questions that the team or the client have about the product.
                    This job mainly involves attending meetings, responding to emails and making phone calls. Having a good time management, organisational skills and an understanding about website design and it’s complexities is essential. </p>
